Freshout's Code Challenges
==========================

Here you will find a weekly code challenge. Each challenge has a README file with the complete instructions,
explanation of the problem to solve and a sample input and output.
What you are going to write is a class or a set of classes each one within its own file, those classes will be
used by a test file. Your goal is to successfully pass all tests.
